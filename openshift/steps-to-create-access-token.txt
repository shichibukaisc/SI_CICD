##Steps to create an access token in GitLab for OpenShift##
0) If you have a non-human service account you can login to (ie machineuser) login using that.  It is a best practice to not tie the builder access token to an actual user account
1) From your project in GitLab, navigate to Settings -> Access Tokens
2) Name the token in the following convention: openshift-read-repo-<application_Acronym> for example: openshift-read-repo-sbras
3) Leave the expiry blank
4) select the read_repository Scope
5) Click create project access token
6) copy the token down!  If you don't, you'll have to delete and recreate the access token

##Using the access token in Openshift##

2) change to the correct project
3) Click on Resources -> Secrets

	Secret Type : Source Secret
